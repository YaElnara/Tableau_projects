## Advanced Revenue Analysis [\[Dash\]](https://public.tableau.com/views/Book4_17170860282300/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
1. Created new sheets to calculate New Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) and Total Revenue with monthly change percentages.
2. Developed a cohort analysis table for revenue by user cohorts.
3. Integrated these sheets into a dashboard with filters for location and date.
4. Applied advanced calculations, including Level of Detail (LOD) expressions and table calculations.
5. Expanded the existing dashboard to include new insights and visualizations.

## User Journey Analysis [\[Dash\]](https://public.tableau.com/shared/YHR75ZF5Q?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
1. Built a dashboard with metrics for registered users, trial period starters, and payers, including conversion rates in tooltips.

## Dashboard Optimization [\[Dash\]](https://public.tableau.com/views/Book6_17181046286520/DashboardHM6?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
1. Applied the 5-second rule, ensuring key insights are accessible within 5 seconds.
2. Positioned important metrics prominently at the top left or first row of the dashboard.
3. Used clear metric labels and units for easy understanding.
4. Rounded values appropriately to avoid cluttering the dashboard with excessive numbers.
5. Ensured a cohesive color scheme with no more than two accent colors for clear visual hierarchy.

## Summary
By completing these tasks, I gained substantial experience in using Tableau for advanced data visualization and analysis. I learned to create calculated fields for key metrics like Total Revenue, Paid Users count, ARPPU, and New MRR. We mastered various visualization techniques, including heat maps, funnel charts, box plots, and cohort analysis tables. Additionally, developed dashboards with interactive filters, Actions, and Parameters, enhancing user engagement and data exploration. The tasks also involved applying advanced Tableau functions like LOD expressions and table calculations. Through these exercises, I improved my ability to visualize and analyze complex datasets, providing clear and actionable insights.
